# 🎮  Vedant Thakre
 
**`Fullstack Developer / Programmer`**

I'm Vedant Thakre, a fullstack developer pretty good with bits and bytes. I have a knack for web development, and those trusty "Ctrl," "C," and "V" keys are my loyal companions. I'm no stranger to problem-solving either, thanks to my experience on platforms like Codeforces and Leetcode. If you ever need someone to work magic in the digital world, I'm your guy. While I may not dive into the technical jargon, I'm passionate about making the online world more functional and user-friendly.
