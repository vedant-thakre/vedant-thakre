# ðŸŽ®  Vedant Thakre
 
**`Fullstack Developer / Programmer`**

I'm a fullstack developer, I have a knack for web development, and those trusty "Ctrl," "C," and "V" keys are my loyal companions. I'm no stranger to problem-solving either, thanks to my experience on platforms like Codeforces and Leetcode. I'm eager to leverage my skills, passion, and drive to contribute to innovative tech projects and collaborate with like-minded professionals. While I may not dive into the technical jargon, I'm passionate about making the online world more functional and user-friendly.
